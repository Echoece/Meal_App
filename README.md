# Meal_App

A new Flutter project.
This project was a testing ground for few things
=> Navigations Basics : different screens were accessed via pages and routes. We can push,pop,replace between pages. also can use named routes and unnamed routes
=> Tabs basics : had options for both bottom or top tab. It let us switch between different stacks. But we cant pop the screens here.
=> passing data : used some non opitmal ways of passing data, directly or via arguments . Data can be passed back too (can read via the future)
=> Drawers & Dialogue : drawers allow us to switch between different stacks. we can close them via Navigator.pop()
