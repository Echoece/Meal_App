# Meal_App

This project was a testing ground for few things
- Navigations Basics : different screens were accessed via pages and routes. We can push,pop,replace between pages. also can use named routes and unnamed routes
- Tabs basics : had options for both bottom or top tab. It let us switch between different stacks. 
- passing data : used some primitive ways of passing data, directly or via arguments . Data can be passed back too (can be read via the future)
- Drawers & Dialogue : drawers allow us to switch between different stacks. we can close them via Navigator.pop()
